## System Components

1. Proxy Re-Encryption Server (PRES): The core component that handles the re-encryption of data. It should be designed to be secure, reliable, and scalable.
2. Key Management System (KMS): Manages the public/private key pairs for all entities (patients, healthcare providers, etc.). It's crucial for the KMS to be highly secure.
3. Access Control Manager (ACM): Manages permissions and access control policies. It decides who can access what data and under what conditions.
4. Blockchain Integration: The system should integrate with the blockchain for immutable logging of access and re-encryption events.

 
## Data Flow
1. Data Encryption: When a patient’s data is initially stored (either on IPFS or another storage system), it's encrypted with the patient's public key.
2. Access Request: When a healthcare provider needs access to a patient's data, they send a request to the ACM.
3. Permission Verification: The ACM checks the request against its access control policies. If approved, it instructs the PRES to re-encrypt the data.
4. Re-Encryption: The PRES re-encrypts the data from the patient's public key to the healthcare provider's public key without decrypting it.
5. Data Access: The healthcare provider receives and decrypts the re-encrypted data using their private key.


### Proposed workflow for Rencryption Server Design

1. Proxy Re-encryption scheme research: There are various PRE schemes like BBS98, AFGH, or NTRU-based schemes. Research and select one that fits your security, performance, and complexity requirements. Leverage existing cryptographic libraries that support Rust. Libraries like rust-crypto, ring, or sodiumoxide can provide the cryptographic primitives
2. API Layer: Design RESTful or gRPC APIs for interaction with the proxy re-encryption server. This layer handles requests from clients and other system components.
3. Encryption/Decryption Service: This service performs the actual re-encryption tasks. It should be isolated and designed to handle high loads.
4. Key Management: Implement a secure system for managing public/private keys. This might involve integrating with a hardware security module (HSM) or a secure key management service.
5. Blockchain Integration: For logging and auditability, integrate with the Aleph Zero blockchain. ??This might involve using a Rust SDK for the blockchain if available. #### Indexer (on-chain) & Logger (Off-chain) 
6. Implement Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming: Utilize Rust's asynchronous programming features to handle multiple re-encryption requests efficiently. Rust's async/await syntax and futures can be used to handle I/O-bound tasks like network requests or blockchain interactions.
7. Testing: Write unit and integration tests for all components. Rust’s cargo tool makes it easy to set up and run tests. Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle the expected transaction throughput.
8. Documentation: API documentation
